# CORINTHIANS PERFORMANCE PLAYING IN THEIR STADIUM (interactive dashboard using PowerBI)
  - This dashboard was created with the aim of being detailed with details, whether of individual players or the weather in general, performance and additional information about it.

## Dataset Used
  -  [DATASET](https://github.com/LucasNatalePires/Corinthians_performanceNeoQuimica/blob/main/CorinthiansDataset.rar), AVAILABLE ON MY REPOSITORY
  -  THIS DATASET HAS BEEN CHANGED FROM THIS [LINK FROM KAGGLE](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danilosoares/arena-corinthians), BECAUSE IT IS IN PORTUGUESE, AND HAS SOME IRRELEVANT COLUMNS


## Questions Answered
### Dashboard 1(MATCH)
- PERFORMANCE (WINS, DRAWS AND DEFEATS) IN GRAPH AND TABLE, DETAILED BY CHAMPIONSHIPS.
   - FILTERED BY SEASON (YEAR), CHAMPIONSHIPS AND OPPONENT TEAM
- FROM THE APPLIED FILTER, IT SHOWS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE MATCH, SUCH AS CHAMPIONSHIP, DATE, OPPONENT, NUMBER OF GOALS, AUDIENCE AND INCOME, JUDGE
- INTERACTIVE MAP WITH LOCATION OF TEAMS THAT WERE FACED
- TABLE THAT LISTS ALL PLAYERS WHO PLAYED, COMPARING THE NUMBER OF TOTAL MATCHES PLAYED, MATCHES PER SEASON, PERCENTAGE DIFFERENCE OF MATCHES PLAYED IN RELATION TO THE PAST SEASON, AND TOTAL ATTENDANCE IN RELATION TO ALL MATCHES PLAYED. THIS ALLOWS TO MAKE A DETAILED ANALYSIS OF THE PLAYERâ€™S IMPORTANCE.
